# MathsExpr

MathsExpr is a little project that jit-compiles mathematical expression and executes them efficiently. It can evaluate up to 4 variables per expression, designated by letters.
This project is very simple and is just a playground around jit compilation and code execution to learn more about assembly, jit-compilation and code optimization.
