# MathsExpr

MathsExpr is a little project that jit-compiles mathematical expression and executes them efficiently. It can evaluate any number of variables per expression, designated by a maximum of 8 letters, and it also has a range of builtin mathematical functions.
This project is very simple and is just a playground around jit compilation and code execution to learn more about assembly, jit-compilation and code optimization.
