# MathExpr

MathExpr is a little project written in vanilla C++23 that jit-compiles mathematical expression and executes them efficiently. It can evaluate any number of variables per expression and has a range of builtin mathematical functions. It is made to explore compilers, backends, as a small experimental project.
